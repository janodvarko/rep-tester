Rep Tester
==========
This tool is intended as simple <b>Reps</b> tester. It connects to the back-end
running in <i>the</i> browser and attaches to the first tab. At this moment,
you need to make sure this page is <i>not</i> the first tab otherwise it
would attach to itself and cause the browser to freeze. This is known limitation
and will be fixed later.

The common scenario is:
1. Launch Firefox and open this tool twice in two tabs.
2. Select the second tab and connect (to the first one).

Setup
-----
Since this app loads source modules directly from Firefox source directory, paths must be properly set.

Webpack config is using the following alias (see `webpack.config` file):

`devtools" => config.firefoxSrc + "/devtools"`

This allows requiring devtools modules (directly from Firefox source dir) as follows:

`require("devtools/client/shared/components/reps/grip");`

All you need to do is set `firefoxSrc` in `config.js` to point to your
Firefox source directory.

The default is:

```
module.exports = {
  firefoxSrc: "../../../mozilla.org/fx-team"
};
```

Run
---
1. `npm install`
2. `webpack`
3. Load `index.html` in Firefox (using your local web server)
4. Follow instructions on the page

Comments
--------
A few more notes about the config:

* React modules are included in `index.html` and marked as external
in `webpack.config`. This makes the bundling process a bit faster.
* Modules coming from the `devtools` directory are not compiled by Babel.
